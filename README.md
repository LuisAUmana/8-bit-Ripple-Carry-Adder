# 8-bit-Ripple-Carry-Adder
Assignment provided by Introduction to VHDL (ECGR 4146)

Objective:
In this lab, you will design an adder of two 8-bit numbers, that outputs the sum and carry by using structural modeling. To construct the adder using structural modeling, first, you need to:

1. Design a Half Adder

2. Design a 1-bit Full Adder using 2 Half Adders

3. Design an 8-bit Ripple Carry Adder using 1-bit Half adder and 1-bit Full adders.

4. Write the Test Bench for Half adder, Full Adder and 8-bit adder.
